## Website Landing Page Notes


**Think your idea can survive the simulation and impress the AI judges?**
The AI-Led Game Show for the Attention Economy


Submission form: https://tally.so/r/3X8EKO


### How can I participate?

Pitch your idea using the submission form. If chosen for the next episode, we'll follow up using the contact info you shared.



### Value prop for DAO

We can add our goals and resources into the writer's room and use the show as a way to scale / add transparency into the partnerships pipeline, treasury management, grants, governance, etc

DAO can get access to deal flow, and projects can get exposure, useful feedback, and connections to capital

### What are future plans?

Improve animations and production value, guest judges, audience participation, integrating realtime data from the DAO into the writer's room to influence decision making.

Also, with a few prompt tweaks it's possible to utilize the framework to judge hackathons or review governance proposals that can be used to produce new types of shows!
