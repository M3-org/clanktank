# WordPress Hackathon Implementation Progress

This document tracks the progress of updating and organizing the WordPress-based hackathon judging system, with a focus on aligning with the canonical Python/React implementation and dashboard best practices.

## Task 1: Dashboard-Inspired API & Data Model Documentation

- [x] Draft new section in implementation-notes.md summarizing dashboard-inspired best practices, endpoint mappings, and data model recommendations for WordPress
- [x] Add new pages as needed to organize the WordPress folder (e.g., api-reference.md, data-model.md)
- [x] Cross-link to canonical docs and dashboard README
- [x] Review and update after each major change

### Notes
- This task ensures the WordPress implementation is API-driven, modular, and compatible with the main dashboard/frontend.
- Used dashboard/app.py and canonical docs for reference.

## Task 2: Implement/Update WordPress Endpoints & Data Model

- [ ] Implement or update all recommended endpoints in api-reference.md
- [ ] Ensure all submission, score, research, and feedback fields are present and exposed in the REST API
- [ ] Test compatibility with dashboard frontend
- [ ] Document any deviations or WP-specific logic

### Notes
- Next step is to implement the endpoints and data model in the actual WP plugin/theme code.
- Will use firecrawl or direct API inspection if more context is needed from the live WP site.
