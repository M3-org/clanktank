# WordPress Hackathon REST API Reference

This page documents the recommended REST API endpoints for the WordPress-based hackathon judging system, inspired by the canonical dashboard implementation and designed for compatibility with a React or static frontend.

## Overview

- All endpoints should be registered under `/wp-json/hackathon/v1/`.
- Data models and field names should match the canonical system (see [hackathon-show-config.md](../hackathon-show-config.md) and [dashboard README](../../scripts/hackathon/dashboard/README.md)).
- Use `register_rest_route` and `register_post_meta`/ACF to expose all necessary fields.

## Notes
- All endpoints should return data in the shape expected by the dashboard frontend for drop-in compatibility.
- Use WP_Query and meta queries for aggregation endpoints (leaderboard, stats).
- For custom fields, use `register_post_meta` or ACF with `show_in_rest: true`.
- For feedback, store reactions and voters in a structured meta field or custom table.
- See [dashboard/app.py](../../scripts/hackathon/dashboard/app.py) for reference implementation.
