# Setup Hackathon Recording Pipeline

## Overview
Configure the existing `shmotime-recorder.js` to record episodes using the JSON files generated by the `hackathon_episode_generator.py`.

## Background
We have a working episode recorder, `shmotime-recorder.js`, that takes a URL and records the content. For the hackathon, we don't need to change the recorder itself, but rather ensure our environment (e.g., a local server or a staging deployment of the PlayCanvas renderer) can serve the hackathon episodes based on our generated JSON files.

## Requirements

### Recording Process
1. **Serve Episode Data**: The JSON files created by `hackathon_episode_generator.py` must be accessible via a URL. This could be achieved by running a simple local web server that serves the `data/hackathon/episodes/` directory, or by deploying them to a web host.
2. **Configure Recorder**: The `shmotime-recorder.js` script will be pointed at the URL serving the hackathon episode.
3. **Automate Recording**: The process of serving and recording should be scriptable, allowing for batch recording of all generated hackathon episodes.
4. **Output Management**: Recorded video files should be saved to a dedicated `recordings/hackathon/` directory with clear, consistent naming (e.g., `HACK_S1E1_Project-Name.mp4`).

### Tasks
- [ ] Create a `recordings/hackathon/` output directory
- [ ] Document how to serve the hackathon episode JSON files locally
- [ ] Create a wrapper script (`scripts/hackathon/record_episodes.sh` or similar) to automate the recording process
- [ ] Define a clear file naming convention for recorded hackathon episodes
- [ ] Test the recording pipeline with a sample hackathon episode JSON
- [ ] Ensure the recorder captures the full episode correctly, including all graphics and audio

## Technical Details

### Example Recording Workflow
```bash
# 1. (If needed) Start a local server to serve the episode files
# python -m http.server 8000 --directory ./data/hackathon/episodes

# 2. Run the recorder pointing to the local episode URL
# The URL must be accessible by the recorder (e.g., http://localhost:8000/HACK_S1E1.json)
node scripts/shmotime-recorder.js \
  --url http://renderer.example.com/play?episode_url=http://localhost:8000/HACK_S1E1.json \
  --output recordings/hackathon/HACK_S1E1_Project-Name.mp4

# 3. An automation script would loop through all generated JSON files
```

## Files to Create/Modify
- **Create**: `scripts/hackathon/record_episodes.sh` (or a Python equivalent) to automate batch recording.
- **Modify**: Potentially add a configuration file for `shmotime-recorder.js` if different settings (e.g., resolution, frame rate) are needed for the hackathon.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Can successfully record a video of a hackathon episode using the generated JSON file
- [ ] Recorded videos are saved to the `recordings/hackathon/` directory
- [ ] The naming convention for video files is followed
- [ ] The process can be automated for batch recording
- [ ] The original `shmotime-recorder.js` script remains unchanged
- [ ] Existing Clank Tank recording pipeline is unaffected

## Dependencies
- Hackathon episode JSON files must be generated (Issue #007)
- A rendering engine (e.g., PlayCanvas build) capable of loading the episode JSON must be accessible via a URL
- `shmotime-recorder.js` and its dependencies (Node.js, Puppeteer) must be installed
