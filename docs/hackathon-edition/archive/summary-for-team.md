# Clank Tank Hackathon Edition - Team Summary

## What We Built Today

We've created a comprehensive plan to adapt Clank Tank for judging hackathons using our AI judges. Here's what's ready for the team:

### ðŸ“š Documentation Created

1. **[Show Configuration](hackathon-show-config.md)**
   - How judges adapt to hackathon context
   - Two-round judging system
   - Scoring criteria (all judges score same 4 categories with expertise weights)
   - Submission form requirements

2. **[Technical Implementation Options](index.md#technical-implementation-options)**
   - Option 1: Use existing Clank Tank infrastructure
   - Option 2: Self-contained WordPress plugin
   - Both approaches fully documented with code examples

3. **[Creative Enhancement Guide](hackathon-creative-notes.md)**
   - Optional visual improvements
   - Interactive AI partner for creative decisions
   - Works with existing 3D environments

4. **[Development Milestones](milestones.md)**
   - 5 phases, 14 weeks total timeline
   - Each milestone ready to become a GitHub issue
   - MVP path identified (6-8 weeks)

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Decisions Made

- **Judges**: All score the same 4 criteria but with different expertise weights
- **Rounds**: Round 1 (AI only) â†’ Community voting â†’ Round 2 (synthesis)
- **Tech Stack**: Can use either existing Python scripts OR WordPress
- **Visuals**: Minimal changes needed, enhancements optional

### ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. **Review as a team** - Discuss approach and timeline
2. **Choose implementation** - Existing infrastructure vs WordPress
3. **Create GitHub issues** - Use milestone templates provided
4. **Assign Phase 1 tasks** - Foundation setup (2 weeks)

### ðŸ’¡ Quick Win Opportunities

- Reuse 90% of existing Clank Tank code
- WordPress version could be a standalone product
- Visual enhancements can be added incrementally
- Community voting via existing Discord bot

### ðŸ“Š Resource Requirements

- **Minimal Team**: 2-3 developers for MVP (6-8 weeks)
- **Full Team**: 4-5 people for complete system (14 weeks)
- **APIs Needed**: OpenRouter, Discord, GitHub, YouTube
