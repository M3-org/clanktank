# Hackathon Implementation Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation progress of the hackathon judging system, following the plan outlined in PLAN.md.

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup
**Status: Completed**

### Objectives
1. **Database Setup**: Create `data/hackathon.db` with hackathon-specific schema ✓
2. **Directory Structure**: Establish `scripts/hackathon/` for all hackathon scripts ✓
3. **Submission Processing**: Create `process_submissions.py` for Google Sheets integration ✓

### Tasks
- [x] Create scripts/hackathon/ directory structure
- [x] Review create_test_db.py and adapt for hackathon schema
- [x] Create data/hackathon.db with proper schema
- [x] Review hackathon_sheet_processor.py for salvageable code
- [x] Create clean process_submissions.py in scripts/hackathon/
- [x] Move obsolete files to scripts/old/
- [ ] Test the submission processing workflow (pending Google Sheets access)

### Critical Rules
- **DO NOT** modify any original Clank Tank scripts or `data/pitches.db`
- **DO NOT** import from or depend on original scripts
- **DO** create everything fresh in `scripts/hackathon/`
- **DO** salvage useful code but refactor for clean separation

### Files Created
- `scripts/hackathon/create_hackathon_db.py` - Database initialization script
- `scripts/hackathon/process_submissions.py` - Standalone submission processor
- `data/hackathon.db` - New SQLite database with hackathon schema

### Implementation Notes
- Created completely separate database schema as specified in Issue 001
- `process_submissions.py` is a clean, standalone implementation with:
  - Google Sheets integration via gspread
  - Validation for required fields and URLs
  - Character limit enforcement
  - Unique submission ID generation using MD5 hash
  - Markdown and JSON export capabilities
- Moved obsolete scripts to `scripts/old/` for archival

## Phase 2: Core Logic
**Status: Partially Complete**

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Issue 003: Hackathon Research Integration
  - Created `scripts/hackathon/hackathon_research.py` with AI-powered project analysis
  - Integrated GitHub repository analyzer for deep code analysis
  - Implemented caching system to minimize API calls
  - Supports both individual and batch research operations
  
- [x] Issue 004: Judge Scoring System
  - Created `scripts/hackathon/hackathon_manager.py` with AI judge personalities
  - Implemented weighted scoring system for each judge
  - Added leaderboard functionality
  - Supports multiple scoring rounds

### Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Issue 005: Discord Bot Integration
- [ ] Issue 006: Round 2 Synthesis

### Implementation Notes
- Created `.env` and `.example.env` files for API key management
- All scripts use environment variables for configuration
- Research script features:
  - Comprehensive GitHub analysis (quality score, commit history, contributors)
  - AI-powered market and technical assessment via OpenRouter/Perplexity
  - Smart caching with 24-hour expiration
- Judge scoring features:
  - Four unique AI judge personalities (Marc, Shaw, Spartan, Peepo)
  - Weighted scoring based on judge expertise
  - Structured prompt engineering for consistent evaluations
  - Database storage of all scores and judge comments

## Phase 3: Content Pipeline
**Status: Draft Complete (Blocked by Phase 2)**

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Issue 007: Episode Generation
  - Created `scripts/hackathon/generate_episode.py` for transforming scored projects into show episodes
  - Implemented AI-powered dialogue generation for host and judges
  - Structured JSON output with events for rendering
  - Support for single and multi-project episodes

- [x] Issue 008: Recording Pipeline
  - Created `scripts/hackathon/record_episodes.sh` wrapper script
  - Integrates with existing shmotime-recorder.js
  - Support for batch recording and local episode serving
  - Organized output to `recordings/hackathon/` directory

- [x] Issue 009: YouTube Upload
  - Created `scripts/hackathon/upload_youtube.py` with Google API integration
  - Automatic metadata generation from hackathon database
  - Thumbnail support and tag generation
  - Database status updates after successful uploads

### Implementation Notes
- **CRITICAL DEPENDENCY**: The final version of the episode generation script requires data from the **Round 2 Synthesis** (Issue #006), which is not yet complete. The current scripts are a functional first draft.
- Episode generation creates compelling narratives with:
  - Host introductions and transitions
  - Judge personality-driven dialogue
  - Score reveals and graphics cues
  - Natural flow between segments
- Recording pipeline supports both local and remote renderers
- YouTube uploader includes:
  - OAuth2 authentication flow
  - Metadata pulled from database
  - Rate limiting for API quotas
  - Dry-run mode for testing

## Phase 4: Web Interface
**Status: Completed**

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Issue 010: Admin Dashboard
  - Created FastAPI backend with comprehensive REST API
  - Built React frontend with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
  - Real-time submission tracking with filtering and sorting
  - Detailed project views with scores and research data
  - Auto-refresh functionality

- [x] Issue 011: Public Leaderboard
  - Integrated into the same application stack
  - Public-facing leaderboard with final rankings
  - Social sharing capabilities
  - Clean, responsive design

### Implementation Notes
- **Backend**: FastAPI with SQLite integration
  - RESTful API endpoints for all data access
  - CORS support for frontend development
  - Static data generation for deployment
- **Frontend**: Modern React stack
  - TypeScript for type safety
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  - React Router for navigation
  - Axios for API communication
- **Features**:
  - Dashboard with real-time updates
  - Advanced filtering by status and category
  - Sortable tables
  - Detailed submission views
  - Public leaderboard with rankings
  - Responsive design for all devices

### Deployment Options
- Development mode with hot reload
- Static site generation for GitHub Pages
- Docker deployment ready
