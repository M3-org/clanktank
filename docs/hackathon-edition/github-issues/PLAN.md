# Mission Plan: Aligning Hackathon Scripts with Final Architecture

## 1. Mission Brief

**Objective:** Systematically review, clean up, and align all existing hackathon-related scripts in the `/scripts` directory with the finalized, canonical plans defined in `/docs/hackathon-edition/github-issues/`.

The primary goal is to transform the partial, pre-plan code into a clean, coherent, and complete set of scripts that perfectly implement our "Separate System" architecture. This involves salvaging useful code, rewriting or refactoring where necessary, and deleting obsolete files to create a pristine `scripts/hackathon/` directory.

---

## 2. Core Principle: The "Separate System" Mandate

This is the most important rule and overrides all else. The hackathon judging platform **must be a completely independent system**.

- **DO:** Create all new scripts within a dedicated `scripts/hackathon/` directory.
- **DO:** Ensure all scripts read from and write to the dedicated `data/hackathon.db` database.
- **DO NOT:** Modify, call, or import from any of the original Clank Tank scripts (e.g., `sheet_processor.py`, `pitch_manager.py`). They are to be considered read-only references at best.
- **DO NOT:** Modify the original `data/pitches.db` database.

---

## 3. State of Affairs

- **The Plan (Canonical):** The `docs/hackathon-edition/github-issues/` directory contains the complete, final, and correct specifications for every component of the hackathon system. These `.md` files are the source of truth.
- **The Code (Pre-existing):** The `/scripts` directory contains several scripts (`hackathon_sheet_processor.py`, `hackathon_research.py`, `judge_scoring.py`, etc.). This work was started **before** the final architecture was locked in.
- **The Task:** Bridge the gap. The existing code represents a head start, but it is not guaranteed to be correct. It must be rigorously audited against "The Plan" and brought into full compliance.

---

## 4. Key Reference Documents

To execute this mission, you must be familiar with the following:

- **`@clanktank-hackathon-context.mdc`**: The high-level project overview, judge personas, and our agreed-upon "Separate System" architecture. This is your primary context.
- **`@/docs/hackathon-edition/github-issues/`**: The folder containing the **detailed specifications** for each task. You will process these files one by one.
- **`@/CLAUDE.md`**: This document describes the **original** Clank Tank system. Its primary use here is to understand what systems and scripts **NOT** to touch.

## 5. Operational Plan: Systematic Review & Implementation

Execute the following steps in order. For each issue, review the specified existing scripts, align them with the plan, and move the final, clean version into `scripts/hackathon/`.

### **Phase 1: Foundation**

**[‚úì] Issue `001-setup-hackathon-database.md`**
- **Goal:** Create the database and a data ingestion script.
- **Plan Spec:** A script named `process_submissions.py` in `scripts/hackathon/`.
- **Existing Scripts to Review:**
    - `scripts/hackathon_sheet_processor.py`
    - `scripts/sheet_processor_hackathon_patch.py`
    - `scripts/create_test_db.py`
- **Action:**
    1.  **Review `create_test_db.py`**. Ensure the schema it creates perfectly matches the schema in `001-setup-hackathon-database.md`. Adapt it if necessary and use it to create `data/hackathon.db`.
    2.  **Review `hackathon_sheet_processor.py`**. This is the most critical piece to salvage.
    3.  **Refactor & Rename:** Refactor this script to be a clean, standalone processor. Rename the final, clean script to `process_submissions.py`.
    4.  **Move:** Place the final `process_submissions.py` into `scripts/hackathon/`.
    5.  **Delete:** The patch file `scripts/sheet_processor_hackathon_patch.py` is obsolete and **must be deleted**. The original `hackathon_sheet_processor.py` should also be deleted after its logic has been moved.

### **Phase 2: Core Logic**

**[‚úì] Issue `003-hackathon-research-integration.md`**
- **Goal:** Create a script for deep GitHub analysis and AI-powered research.
- **Plan Spec:** `hackathon_research.py`.
- **Existing Scripts to Review:**
    - `scripts/hackathon_research.py`
    - `scripts/github_analyzer.py`
- **Action:**
    1.  **Review & Verify:** These scripts likely represent a strong start. Carefully audit their functionality against the detailed requirements in `003-hackathon-research-integration.md`.
    2.  **Confirm Deep Analysis:** Ensure the GitHub analysis is as thorough as specified (commit history, fork status, contributor count, etc.) and that the AI prompt is sophisticated.
    3.  **Align & Move:** Make any necessary adjustments, ensure they write to `hackathon.db`, and move both final scripts into `scripts/hackathon/`.

**[‚úì] Issue `004-judge-scoring-system.md`**
- **Goal:** Implement the AI judge scoring system.
- **Plan Spec:** A script named `judge_scoring.py` (the issue mentions `hackathon_manager.py`, but `judge_scoring.py` is the better, existing name).
- **Existing Scripts to Review:**
    - `scripts/judge_scoring.py`
    - `scripts/test_judge_scoring.py`
- **Action:**
    1.  **Audit:** Review `judge_scoring.py` against the spec in `004-judge-scoring-system.md`.
    2.  **Verify Logic:** Confirm that the judge personas, expertise weights, and prompt templates are implemented exactly as planned.
    3.  **Align & Move:** After verification, move both `judge_scoring.py` and its test file `test_judge_scoring.py` into the `scripts/hackathon/` directory.

**[‚úì] Issue `005-discord-bot-integration.md`**
- **Goal:** Create a Discord bot for community voting.
- **Plan Spec:** `discord_bot.py`.
- **Existing Scripts to Review:** None.
- **Action:**
    1.  **Create New Script:** This script must be created from scratch.
    2.  **Implement Spec:** Implement all features as defined in `005-discord-bot-integration.md`, especially the hybrid emoji voting system (`üí°`,`üíª`,`üìà`,`üòç` + `üî•`).
    3.  **Save:** Place the new script at `scripts/hackathon/discord_bot.py`.

**[‚úì] Issue `006-round2-synthesis.md`**
- **Goal:** Implement the Round 2 logic that combines judge scores and community feedback.
- **Plan Spec:** Logic to be added to the scoring manager (`judge_scoring.py`).
- **Existing Scripts to Review:**
    - `scripts/hackathon/judge_scoring.py` (once moved).
- **Action:**
    1.  **Extend:** Add the Round 2 synthesis functionality to the existing `judge_scoring.py` script.
    2.  **Implement Narrative Prompt:** Ensure the prompt for the final verdict encourages a narrative response from the AI, as specified in the issue file.
    3.  **Verify Scoring:** Double-check that the final score calculation (R1 weighted score + community bonus) is correct.

### **Phase 3 & 4: Content Pipeline & Web Interface**

**[‚úì] Issues `007` through `011`**
- **Goal:** Create the content generation pipeline and the web dashboard.
- **Plan Spec:** `generate_episode.py`, recording scripts, `upload_youtube.py`, and the FastAPI/React application in `scripts/hackathon/dashboard/`.
- **Existing Scripts to Review:** None.
- **Action:**
    1.  **Create New:** All of these components are net new. They must be built from scratch following their respective `.md` specifications.
    2.  **Strict Adherence:** Pay close attention to the detailed JSON structure for episode generation and the API endpoints for the web app.

## 6. Cleanup Protocol

- **Create Archive:** Create a `scripts/archive/` directory.
- **Move Obsolete Scripts:** Before deleting, you may move the original versions of the scripts you've refactored (e.g., the original `hackathon_sheet_processor.py`) into this `archive` folder. This provides a temporary backup.
- **Delete Obsolete Files:** Files that are completely unnecessary, like `sheet_processor_hackathon_patch.py`, should be deleted directly.
- **Final State:** When this mission is complete, the `/scripts` directory should contain only the original Clank Tank scripts, the new `scripts/hackathon/` directory (filled with clean, aligned scripts), and the `scripts/archive/` directory.
