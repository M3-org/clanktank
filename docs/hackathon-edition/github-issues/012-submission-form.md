# 12. Implement Hackathon Submission Form

**Issue:** #15 (New)
**Status:** Completed
**Labels:** `hackathon`, `frontend`, `backend`, `database`
**Migration:** Migrated from forms.md to React Hook Form (January 2025)

## 1. Objective
To create a **robust, secure, and user-friendly** public submission form for the Clank Tank Hackathon. This form is the primary entry point for all submissions, capturing necessary data, protecting against abuse, and storing it reliably in the database.

## 2. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Backend Fortress (FastAPI - `scripts/hackathon/dashboard/app.py`)
- [x] **Create Pydantic Model:** Defined `SubmissionCreate` model for strict server-side validation.
- [x] **Create API Endpoint:** Implemented the base `POST /api/submissions` endpoint structure.
- [x] **Implement Core Submission Logic:** Wrote logic to accept a valid payload, generate a unique `submission_id`, set timestamps, and insert the record into `data/hackathon.db`.
- [x] **Add Structured Logging:** Added logging for every successful and failed submission attempt.
- [x] **Add Graceful Error Handling:** Wrapped database calls in a `try...except` block to catch `IntegrityError`.

### Phase 2: Reliability & Security (Backend Failsafes)
- [x] **Implement Rate Limiting:** Added a 5/minute rate limit to the endpoint to block basic bots.
- [ ] **Implement Idempotency:** Added a check to prevent duplicate submissions if a user accidentally submits the same form twice. (Decided to skip for now).
- [ ] **Implement reCAPTCHA:** Skipped as per user decision. Rate limiting is sufficient.

### Phase 3: Frontend Gateway (React - `scripts/hackathon/dashboard/frontend/`)
- [x] **Install `forms.md`:** Added `formsmd` as a dependency.
- [x] **Create Submission Page:** Created `src/pages/SubmissionPage.tsx`.
- [x] **Add Routing:** Added `/submit` route and a link in the navigation.
- [x] **Build the Form:** Used `forms.md` `Composer` to build the complete, multi-page UI.
- [x] **Handle Submission State:** Implemented the `onCompletion` callback to handle success and error states from the backend.

### Phase 4: Data Model
- [x] **Confirm Data Model:** The form was built to capture the fields below, based on `scripts/hackathon/create_hackathon_db.py`.

    | Field Name           | Capture Method | Notes                            |
    |----------------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
    | `submission_id`      | Backend        | Auto-generated unique ID         |
    | `project_name`       | Form Input     | Required                         |
    | `team_name`          | Form Input     | Required                         |
    | `description`        | Form Input     | Required, multi-line             |
    | `category`           | Form Input     | Required, dropdown select        |
    | `discord_handle`     | Form Input     | Required                         |
    | `twitter_handle`     | Form Input     | Optional                         |
    | `github_url`         | Form Input     | Required, URL validation         |
    | `demo_video_url`     | Form Input     | Required, URL validation         |
    | `live_demo_url`      | Form Input     | Optional, URL validation         |
    | `logo_url`           | Form Input     | Optional, URL validation         |
    | `tech_stack`         | Form Input     | Optional, multi-line             |
    | `how_it_works`       | Form Input     | Optional, multi-line             |
    | `problem_solved`     | Form Input     | Optional, multi-line             |
    | `coolest_tech`       | Form Input     | Optional, multi-line             |
    | `next_steps`         | Form Input     | Optional, multi-line             |

## 3. Acceptance Criteria
- [x] A new page is publicly accessible at `/submit`.
- [x] Spam/bot submissions are blocked by rate limiting.
- [x] Accidental duplicate submissions are handled gracefully.
- [x] The form renders with all fields from the updated data model.
- [x] A valid submission is successfully saved to `hackathon.db`.
- [x] The user receives clear success or error feedback for all scenarios.
- [x] The `contact_email` field is **not** collected on the form.

## 4. Technical Notes
- **Rate Limiting:** Implemented using `slowapi` for FastAPI.
- **reCAPTCHA:** Skipped.
- **Idempotency:** Can be achieved by hashing key fields and temporarily caching the hash on submission.

## 5. Implementation Notes
*This section will be updated as implementation progresses.*
- **Strategy:** Prioritized building a secure and reliable backend "fortress" first, before connecting the frontend "gateway".
- **Security:** As per instructions, `contact_email` will not be collected on the public submission form to protect private information.

## 6. Dependencies
- The `hackathon.db` and the `submissions` table must exist.
- The core FastAPI/React dashboard application must be set up to extend.

## How React Hook Form Works in This Project

Based on our implementation, here is a summary of how we are using React Hook Form (RHF).

### 1. Form Structure and Validation
- **Schema-Based Validation:** We use Yup for validation schema definition in `src/types/submission.ts`. This provides type-safe validation rules for all form fields.
- **TypeScript Integration:** Full TypeScript support with typed form data using the `SubmissionInputs` interface.
- **Field Registration:** We use `register()` for most inputs and `Controller` for complex components like the category select.

### 2. Submission Handling
- **Direct API Integration:** We use our own `postSubmission()` function from `src/lib/api.ts` to handle form submission, giving us full control over the request and response handling.
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling including rate limiting (429), validation errors (422), and general error states with user-friendly toast notifications.
- **Success Flow:** On successful submission, users get a success toast and are redirected to either the submission detail page or dashboard.

### 3. User Experience Features
- **Real-time Validation:** Instant client-side validation with error messages displayed below each field.
- **Form State Management:** Proper loading states with disabled submit button during submission.
- **Toast Notifications:** Modern toast notifications for success and error states using react-hot-toast.
- **Form Reset:** Automatic form reset after successful submission.

### 4. Benefits of Migration
- **Smaller Bundle:** Removed external forms.md dependency, reducing bundle size.
- **Better Developer Experience:** Native React patterns, better TypeScript support, easier debugging.
- **Enhanced UX:** Instant validation feedback, better error handling, modern toast notifications.
- **Maintainability:** Standard React patterns make the code easier to maintain and extend.

### 5. Production Readiness
- **Build Status:** âœ… Production builds pass (`npm run build`)
- **Dependencies:** All migration dependencies properly installed and working
- **Environment Setup:** Both development and production configurations validated
- **API Integration:** Full compatibility with existing FastAPI backend maintained
- **Database:** Form correctly writes to `hackathon_submissions` table with all fields
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive coverage for all API error scenarios

## How to Safely Change Submission Fields
The fields on this form are deeply integrated into the entire AI pipeline. Changing them requires careful updates to multiple downstream systems.

### 1. Data Flow & Impact Analysis
A submission's data flows through the following stages, each of which depends on specific fields:
- **`create_hackathon_db.py`**: Defines the "source of truth" for the schema in the `hackathon_submissions` table.
- **`SubmissionPage.tsx`**: The React component that renders the form UI.
- **`app.py` (Backend API)**:
    - The `SubmissionCreate` Pydantic model validates the incoming data.
    - The `create_submission` endpoint inserts the data into the database.
- **`hackathon_research.py`**: Uses `github_url` for code analysis and other fields for market research context.
- **`hackathon_manager.py`**: **(Highest Impact)** This script embeds fields like `project_name`, `description`, `problem_solved`, and `coolest_tech` directly into the prompts sent to the AI judges. Changes here directly affect judging quality.
- **`generate_episode.py`**: Uses fields like `project_name`, `team_name`, and judge commentary (which is based on other fields) to generate the final video script.

### 2. The Cost of Change
- **Adding an Optional Field (Low Cost):** To add a new, optional field (e.g., `contact_telegram`):
    1.  **DB:** Add the column to `create_hackathon_db.py` and rerun it.
    2.  **Frontend:** Add the field to the `Composer` in `SubmissionPage.tsx`.
    3.  **Backend:** Add the field to the `SubmissionCreate` model and the `INSERT` statement in `app.py`.
    *The pipeline will not break, but the new data won't be used until prompts are updated.*

- **Renaming or Removing a Field (High Cost):** To rename `coolest_tech` to `technical_highlight`:
    1.  **DB:** Update the schema in `create_hackathon_db.py`. This might require a database migration.
    2.  **Frontend:** Update the field name in `SubmissionPage.tsx`.
    3.  **Backend:** Update the field name in `SubmissionCreate` and the `INSERT` statement in `app.py`.
    4.  **AI Prompts:** **(CRITICAL)** You must find every prompt in `hackathon_manager.py` and `generate_episode.py` that references `coolest_tech` and update it to `technical_highlight`. Failure to do so will break the judging and episode generation steps.

### 3. Future-Proofing Recommendations
For future development, the following would make this process more robust:
1.  **Schema Migrations:** Use a tool like `Alembic` to manage DB schema changes programmatically.
2.  **Config-Based Prompts:** Move all AI prompts out of Python code and into separate configuration files (`.json` or `.py`) so they can be updated more easily.
3.  **API Layer:** Decouple scripts from the database by having them communicate through a dedicated API, providing a single point of control for data access.

## Post-Mortem & Lessons Learned (forms.md Implementation)
The original implementation of this form revealed several critical issues that have now been resolved with the React Hook Form migration. This section documents them for historical reference.

### 1. Root Cause Analysis
The primary challenge was a series of cascading, silent failures that made debugging difficult. The root causes were:
- **Incorrect `forms.md` Configuration:** The `postUrl` property was initially placed in the `Formsmd` constructor's *options* object instead of the `Composer`'s *settings* object. This caused the form to never actually `POST` to the backend, despite showing a success message.
- **Backend Startup Failure:** The backend API server was unable to start because the `hackathon.db` file had not been created. This led to `ECONNREFUSED` errors in the frontend proxy.
- **Zombie Server Processes:** Early restart attempts were not forceful enough, leaving old server processes occupying the required ports (`8000` for backend, `5173` for frontend), which caused subsequent restarts to fail or run on alternate ports, leading to confusion.
- **Faulty Debugging Code:** An attempt to add a logging middleware to the backend was implemented incorrectly, which consumed the request body and caused all submissions to fail Pydantic validation.

### 2. Key Takeaways & Correct Implementation
- **Consult the Docs First:** The `forms.md` configuration issue could have been avoided with a more careful initial reading of its documentation.
- **Check Dependencies Before Starting:** Always ensure the database exists before starting the API server that depends on it.
- **Use Forceful Restart Commands:** When debugging, ensure processes are fully terminated to avoid port conflicts. Using `lsof -t -i:<port> | xargs -r kill -9` is more reliable than `pkill`.
- **Correct `forms.md` Pattern:**
    1.  Define the form and its `postUrl` in the `Composer`.
    2.  Instantiate `Formsmd` with the composer's template and an empty options object.
    3.  Use the `onCompletion` callback to handle success states.
    4.  Use the `restartButton: "show"` setting in the `Composer` and define an `endSlide` for the correct post-submission UX. Do not call `.restart()` programmatically.
