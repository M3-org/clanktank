# Hackathon Folder Cleanup & Reorganization Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Improve maintainability and readability
- Make code and scripts easy to discover and use
- Avoid deep or confusing nesting
- Enable clean imports (no ../ or relative hacks)
- Keep documentation and tests accurate

---

## 0. Source of Truth & Pipeline Overview (2025-07-02)

### ðŸ“‚ **Backend & Schema**
- **API & Logic:** `hackathon/backend/app.py` (FastAPI endpoints, business logic)
- **Schema:** `hackathon/backend/submission_schema.json` (required/optional fields for v1/v2)
- **Schema Loader:** `hackathon/backend/schema.py` (loads schema, exposes helpers)
- **Scripts:** `hackathon/scripts/` (DB, migration, recovery, batch tools)
- **Prompts:** `hackathon/prompts/` (judge personas, dialogue, etc.)

### ðŸ“„ **Most Up-to-Date Documentation**
- **docs/hackathon-edition/submission-pipeline-robustness.md** (last updated: 2025-07-02)
  - Covers: pipeline, schema, validation, backup, error handling, admin tools, E2E flow

### ðŸ”— **How to Align Tests**
- Always check `submission_schema.json` for required/optional fields
- Reference `app.py` for endpoint contracts
- Use `submission-pipeline-robustness.md` for operational details

  backend/            # Backend logic (API, DB, business logic, scoring, research)
    app.py
    db.py
    schema.py

```

## 2. Migration Steps

### 2.1. Create New Folders
- `backend/`
- `scripts/`
- `bots/`
- Ensure `prompts/`, `episodes/`, `tests/` exist

### 2.2. Move Files
- Move backend logic (API, DB, business logic, scoring, research) to `backend/`
- Move CLI/admin/batch scripts to `scripts/`
- Move Discord and other bots to `bots/`
- Leave `prompts/`, `episodes/`, `tests/` as is

### 2.3. Add `__init__.py` Files
- Add empty `__init__.py` to `hackathon/`, `backend/`, `prompts/`, `bots/`, and `tests/` for package recognition

### 2.4. Update Imports
- Change all imports to use absolute package imports, e.g.:
  ```python
  from hackathon.prompts.judge_personas import ...
  ```
- Remove any `..` or relative import hacks

### 2.5. Update Documentation
- Update all file path references in markdown files and code comments
- Add a "Project Structure" section to `hackathon/README.md`

### 2.6. Update Test Imports
- Update test imports to match new structure
- Ensure all tests run from the project root using `python -m` or `pytest`

### 2.7. Test Everything
- Run all tests to ensure nothing is broken
- Run main scripts using `python -m hackathon.backend.hackathon_manager` etc.

---

## 3. Best Practices
- Use absolute imports within the `hackathon/` package
- Keep `prompts/` top-level for shared access
- Keep scripts and backend logic separate for clarity
- Document any new conventions in `README.md`

## 5. Post-Cleanup Checklist
- [ ] All files moved to new locations
- [ ] All imports updated to absolute imports
- [ ] All `__init__.py` files added
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] All documentation references updated
- [ ] README project structure section added/updated

---

## 6. Rollout Tips
- Do the migration in a feature branch
- Commit after each major step (file moves, import updates, doc updates)
- Use search/replace for import and doc path updates
- Test after each step
- Ask for code review before merging to main

---

## 7. Test Fix & Alignment Plan (2025-07-02)

### **A. Extract Schema Requirements**
- Parse `hackathon/backend/submission_schema.json` for v1/v2 required fields
- Document these in a table for test reference

### **B. Audit & Update Test Payloads**
- For each test that POSTs a submission:
  - Ensure all required fields are present (per schema version)
  - Use unique values for fields like `project_name`/`submission_id`
  - Use a helper for uniqueness

### **C. Test Structure & Environment**
- All test functions use `assert`, not `return`
- Use setup/teardown or fixtures to reset DB before each test that modifies it
- Mark/skip tests that require backend/frontend if not available

### **D. Remove/Refactor Outdated Tests**
- Remove or update tests that are no longer relevant to the current schema or API

### **E. Post-Fix Checklist**
- [ ] All test payloads match schema
- [ ] All tests use `assert`
- [ ] DB is reset/clean for each test
- [ ] Tests requiring services are marked/skipped if unavailable
- [ ] All tests pass

1. `test_api_endpoints.py`
2. `test_complete_submission.py`
3. `test_image_upload.py`
4. `test_robust_pipeline.py`
