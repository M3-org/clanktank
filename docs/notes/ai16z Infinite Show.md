# M3TV Setup with Eliza Agents

## Overview
Plan to build a dynamic AI-powered streaming service similar to popular AI-generated channels (e.g., Seinfeld AI). This includes designing characters, sets, and tech infrastructure while incorporating Eliza agents for conversational interactions.

---

## Backrooms

- Currently agents are interacting with each other + humans mostly in backrooms chats + X or telegram
- We want to surface interactions into a livestream show format



---

## To-Do List

### 1. **Technical Infrastructure Setup**
- **Environment**
  - Use **local + VPS** for stability.
  - Consider a **dedicated AI machine** for running Eliza agents
  - Keep critical apps like **Solana wallet** separate for security

- **Hardware**
  - Leverage high-performance setups like **Mac Minis (M series)** for rendering or running AI models (64GB unified memory recommended).

- **Web Solution**
  - Consider **web approach** with fewer dependencies.
  - Use **streaming platforms (e.g., Twitch)** for scalability instead of individual visitor API calls.

---

### 2. **AI Characters & Scripts**
- **Character Design**
  - Utilize characters people already created
  - Use **JSON** to organize scripts, scene setups, and character interactions.

- **Script Generation**
  - Automate writing with AI
  - Topics: Decide on themes or key areas of interaction for characters.

- **Live Interactions**
  - Enable **human interjections** during live streams to enhance humor and prevent infinite AI loops.
  - Develop a "Director Mode" where humans can influence live scenes.

---

### 3. **Technical Details**
- **Tools & Frameworks**
  - Investigate Unity / threejs / PlayCanvas for scene control.
      - Perhaps collaborate with ashxn + Waybound?
  - Utilize **OBS** for live streaming and scene switching.

- **Lipsync**
  - Research server-side solutions for **TTS with phoneme synchronization** (e.g., node.js libraries).



---

### 4. **Entertainment Features**
- **Integration with Eliza**
  - Hook Eliza agents to the system for interactive conversational capabilities.
  - Configure **Director Mode** to control:
    - Camera movements.
    - AI interactions.
    - Scene transitions.

- **AI Infinite Loop**
  - Let AI agents interact autonomously to "learn" and generate content.
  - Simulate long-term AI "thought" processes for innovation.

---

### 5. **Development Workflow**
- **Collaborators**
  - Engage developers for:
    - Frontend design (**R3F/Three.js** experience preferred).
    - Backend systems and OBS configurations.

- **Iteration**
  - Test with small sets of agents and environments.
  - Optimize response times and avoid echoing/double responses in scripts.

---

### 6. **Long-Term Vision**
- Incorporate:
  - **Calandy automation** for scheduling AI interactions.
  - Scalable AI agent management for evolving content.
- Experiment with **autonomous AI R&D loops** for innovation and story development.
