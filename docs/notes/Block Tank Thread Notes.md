# Block Tank Thread Notes


1/ Time to share more info about the crypto shark tank show my team has been working on, including how you can pitch your project to the AI judges ðŸ§µ


2/ How's it work?

Users submit a pitch with details about their idea AND themselves. We make an AI character + voice for the pitcher who then interact with the AI judges

The system generates a complete episode simulation in 15-20 seconds, playable in-browser for fast iteration


3/ Under the Hood

Here's a data flow of how episodes are created. It's a modular and interoperable system, giving us the ability to easily swap assets and generate using different rendering pipelines

Current demo runs on @playcanvas, we're open to exploring Unity / Unreal also


4/ We can add our goals and resources into the writer's room and use the show as a way to scale partnerships, treasury management, grants, governance, etc

DAO can get access to deal flow, and projects can get exposure, useful feedback, and connections to capital

5/ If you want to pitch your idea to the AIs, fill-out this form and we'll reach out: https://tally.so/r/3X8EKO

Also seeking to replace "What Did You Get Done This Week?" spaces with one you can pitch your ideas in and a few become new episodes. Open to collab on this, DMs open!

Block Tank uses an AI "writers' room" to script the show's flow and dialogue. The current version has a single AI thinking like a Hollywood writer. 

Future plans include a multi-agent writers' room with AI judges drawing from unique personality profiles for nuanced interactions.

After the lightning-fast simulation, episodes can be reviewed and published. The system's event-based approach allows the same episode data to generate 2D, 3D or even VR visualizations! 

Human moderation is used to prevent spam & prompt engineering while enabling community voting.

Block Tank opens exciting possibilities for tokenomics & community engagement.

Imagine pitch submission fees to incentivize quality & cover AI costs. Or viewers voting on pitches to greenlight & even influencing judges' decisions!


Under the hood, Block Tank uses an interoperable JSON format. The demo ran real-time 3D in a browser using PlayCanvas, with a Unity version showcasing VR.

The modular system can swap components like the writers' room or visualizers, and add new scenes, characters & elements.

 Block Tank points to a future where communities rapidly generate unique, dynamic shows with AI & audience input. The "submit, simulate, share" flow has potential across genres - from game shows to dramas.

 Here's a technical Twitter thread on Block Tank, the AI-powered show generator that parodies Shark Tank in the Web3 space:

1/ Block Tank allows users to submit pitches which get transformed into AI-generated episodes. The system creates an AI agent to represent the pitcher, who interacts with AI judges in a simulated show. 

The user provides details about their pitch idea and themselves. This forms the basis for the AI pitcher and the episode's content.

2/ Under the hood, Block Tank uses an "AI Writers Room" to script the show's flow and dialogue. This could be a single AI acting as a Hollywood writer, or a multi-agent system where each judge's AI draws from unique personality profiles.

The multi-agent approach enables nuanced character interactions based on their defined traits and expertise.

3/ Once the lightning-fast simulation is complete, the episode can be reviewed and published. Block Tank's modular design means the same episode data can generate 2D, 3D or VR visualizations.

The system uses an interoperable JSON format at its core. The demo showcased real-time 3D rendering in-browser using PlayCanvas.

4/ Block Tank opens exciting opportunities for tokenomics and community engagement. Imagine pitch submission fees to incentivize quality and cover AI costs. Users could even vote on pitches and influence the judges' decisions.

5/ The future of Block Tank involves higher-quality art assets, advanced multi-agent writers rooms, and deeper audience interaction. The platform's flexibility means it could expand to other show formats beyond its current Shark Tank inspiration.

6/ Block Tank points to a new era of community-driven, AI-powered interactive entertainment. Its rapid "submit, simulate, share" cycle has potential across genres. 

Excited to see how this technology evolves and the experiences it enables! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Here's a new Twitter thread explaining Block Tank, the AI-powered show generator:
1/ Introducing Block Tank - a platform that transforms user-submitted pitches into AI-generated shows. It's like Shark Tank, but with virtual judges, contestants, and an infinite variety of topics.
Here's how it works under the hood:
2/ When a user submits a pitch, they provide details about their idea and background. Block Tank uses this to create an AI agent that represents the pitcher during the show.
This AI agent can interact with the virtual judges, responding to questions and comments in real-time based on the user's input.
3/ At the heart of Block Tank is the "AI Writers Room". This system takes the user's pitch, the AI pitcher, and the profiles of the virtual judges, and generates a complete show script.
The AI Writers Room can be a single entity, like a virtual Hollywood screenwriter, or a multi-agent system where judge AIs collaborate and bounce ideas off each other.
4/ Once the AI Writers Room finishes the script, Block Tank runs a detailed simulation of the show. This includes dialogue, interactions, and the final judgment from the AI panel.
The whole process, from pitch submission to simulated episode, only takes 15-20 seconds. The system can then render this simulation in various formats - text, 2D animation, 3D scenes, or even VR experiences.
5/ One of the most exciting aspects of Block Tank is the potential for audience interaction and community-driven content.
For example, users could vote on which pitches they want to see turned into full episodes. They could even participate as virtual judges, influencing the direction and outcome of the show.
6/ Block Tank also opens up interesting possibilities for tokenomics. Imagine a system where users spend tokens to submit high-quality pitches or to influence the judges' decisions.
This could create a vibrant ecosystem around the platform, encouraging participation and innovation.
7/ As Block Tank evolves, we can expect to see even more sophisticated AI writing systems, higher quality visuals, and deeper audience engagement.
The platform's modular design means it can be extended to all sorts of show formats beyond the initial Shark Tank concept. The possibilities are endless.
8/ Ultimately, Block Tank represents a glimpse into the future of entertainment - one where AI and human creativity work together to generate compelling, interactive content at scale.
It's an exciting frontier, and we can't wait to see what kinds of new experiences and stories emerge from this innovative platform.
