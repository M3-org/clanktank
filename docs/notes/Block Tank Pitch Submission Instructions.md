# Block Tank Pitch Submission Instructions

Date: 2/2/25

Follow these steps to submit your idea to the **ElizaOS DAO** for potential funding & become a **Block Tank episode**.

## 1. Submission Form
Fill out the official submission form here: https://tally.so/r/3X8EKO

## 2. Wait for Acceptance
If your pitch submission is accepted you will be contacted by our Supervising Producer **Jin** who will schedule an **actual meeting w/ you & the ElizaOS DAO leadership in a Discord group call**.

You will deliver your actual pitch during to the ElizaOS DAO leadership in this meeting, with **Jin** recording the pitch into a transcript.

After the meeting **Jin** will inform you of the DAO's decision on funding (if it was not decided upon **during** the meeting.)

Even if you are not selected for funding - being featured in a Block Tank episode can drive considerable attention to your project that you may benefit from.

## 3. Episode Segment Production
After all that - your form submission & your pitch information (plus the transcript of the actual meeting you had w/ DAO leadership) will be fed into our AI show writer who will turn it into an entertaining Block Tank segment with AI characters portraying you & the judges.

It may take up to 2 weeks after your meeting for your segment to be featured in an episode of Block Tank.

## 4. Showtime
Congratulations! When the episode that featurs your segment airs you will be notified by **Jin** with a link to view/share it. No matter the outcome we hope the exposure benefits your project. For projects that receive funding - the details of the funding will be worked out privately between you & the DAO leadership.
