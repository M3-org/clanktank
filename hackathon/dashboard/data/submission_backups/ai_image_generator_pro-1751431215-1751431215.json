    "how_it_works": "Our system uses a fine-tuned stable diffusion model combined with custom LoRA adapters to generate high-quality images from text descriptions. The backend is built with FastAPI and the frontend uses React with real-time WebSocket updates.",
    "problem_solved": "Current AI image generators are expensive, slow, or produce low-quality results. Our solution provides fast, high-quality image generation at affordable prices with an intuitive interface.",
    "favorite_part": "The real-time generation preview that shows the image being created step-by-step, giving users insight into the AI's creative process.",
