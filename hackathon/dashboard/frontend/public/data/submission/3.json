  "description": "REFRAKTOR is an interactive 3D audio-visual synthesizer for the web. It combines real-time sound generation with a dynamic 3D scene, allowing users to create evolving soundscapes and visuals by manipulating a variety of parameters.\n\nThe user interface is composed of several draggable panels, each controlling a different aspect of the synthesizer:\n\nGeneral: Master sound toggle and the ability to add a second, independently-controlled \"lens\" to the scene.\n\n- Master: A master volume control and a \"Panic\" button to reset the audio engine.\n- Sound: Control the core sound with a waveform selector (sine, square, etc.), an interactive ADSR envelope visualizer, and sliders for Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release, and note Duration.\n- Filter: Shape the sound with a multi-mode filter (lowpass, highpass, etc.) and controls for Frequency and Q (Resonance).\n- Lens 1 & 2: Manipulate the cymatics simulation by controlling the frequency and amplitude of the wave patterns on the lenses.\n- Music: Enable a \"Chord Magnet\" to gently pull notes towards a defined musical scale for more harmonic results.\n- Bloom: Adjust the post-processing bloom effect, controlling its strength, radius, and threshold to create a glowing, ethereal look.\n- MIDI: Enable MIDI output to send the generated notes to external hardware or software synthesizers.\n- Presets: Save the entire state of the application to a JSON file, and load presets to instantly recall your favorite sounds and settings.\n\nDemo: https://gm3.github.io/refraktor/",

The MIDI output feature shows they understand real musician workflows, not just demo aesthetics. The preset system using JSON serialization is exactly how I'd architect it for extensibility. What really gets me is the 'Chord Magnet' feature - that's the kind of thoughtful UX that comes from actually using your own tools. The bloom post-processing might seem like visual fluff, but it's GPU-optimized and doesn't interfere with the audio thread.
