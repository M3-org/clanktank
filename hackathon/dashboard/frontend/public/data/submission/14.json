  "problem_solved": "Despite advancements in agriculture and technology, food insecurity remains a global issue, but Urban gardening, homesteading and farmers markets are on the rise.

I want to build a swarm of AI agent soil microbiologists that will coach new and inexperienced urban gardeners from seed to harvest. ",
