  "description": "Otaku is an AI agent built on ElizaOS that focuses on DeFi workflows on the Base L2 network. It offers Morpho Blue lending, token deployment through Clanker (SDK v4.0.0), cross-chain bridging via LiFi, and data-driven analytics through 19 defined actions across five plugins.",

  "problem_solved": "DeFi complexity creates barriers: users can't efficiently analyze yields across protocols, manage cross-chain positions, assess liquidation risks, or execute complex strategies safely. Traditional tools require deep technical knowledge and manual coordination across multiple platforms. Otaku eliminates these friction points by providing a unified Conversational AI interface that executes professional-grade DeFi operations through natural language commands, with built-in risk management, real-time monitoring, and automated optimization across multiple protocols.",

They're using the library, not extending it. Cross-chain via LiFi? Again, just wrapper code. Where are the custom risk models I asked for? Where's the novel DeFi primitive that makes me go 'oh shit, that's clever'? The high judge consensus at 0.4 variance tells me we all saw the same thing: technically competent but creatively bankrupt.
