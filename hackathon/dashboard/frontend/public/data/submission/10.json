  "problem_solved": "DeFi complexity creates barriers: users can't efficiently analyze yields across protocols, manage cross-chain positions, assess liquidation risks, or execute complex strategies safely. Traditional tools require deep technical knowledge and manual coordination across multiple platforms. Otaku eliminates these friction points by providing a unified Conversational AI interface that executes professional-grade DeFi operations through natural language commands, with built-in risk management, real-time monitoring, and automated optimization across multiple protocols.",
  "favorite_part": "Integrating Base-focused plugins into a coherent action flow and validating each step with on-chain data.",
