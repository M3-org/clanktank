Think about it: every AI company needs to showcase their agents' capabilities in a visceral, competitive way. This could be the 'chess match' of the AI era - a standardized benchmark wrapped in entertainment. The lack of commits during the hackathon still bothers me, but if they can pivot this into an agent evaluation platform disguised as a game, we're looking at a potential B2B SaaS play with real legs. The TAM isn't just gamers - it's every AI company that needs to demo their agents in action.",
