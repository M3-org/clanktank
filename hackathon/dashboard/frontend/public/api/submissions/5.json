That's not building, that's ctrl+c/ctrl+v. The 'personalized Chinese astrology platform' is just a database lookup with some AI fairy dust sprinkled on top - we're talking about wrapping ancient superstition in a React component and calling it innovation. The technical stack is pedestrian at best: standard web tech, no novel algorithms, no interesting data structures, just CRUD operations dressed up with mystical terminology. Even if we're being generous about the cultural preservation angle, there's no moat here - any competent dev could clone this in a weekend. The community's tepid response (1 like? Really?) confirms what we already know: this isn't solving a real problem, it's solving a 'I need to submit something to this hackathon' problem.",

They've actually built a working product with: 1) Complex astrological calculations (Zi Wei Dou Shu is non-trivial math), 2) Solana payment integration for credits, 3) AI-powered chat interface for readings, 4) Bilingual support. The architecture probably involves a decent backend for chart generation, payment processing, and OpenAI integration. Sure, it's not pushing technical boundaries like some blockchain primitives would, but it's a complete product with real users. The 'Other' category placement is sus though - this is clearly a consumer app leveraging Web3 for payments.

The provided repository contains no code, no implementation, and no evidence of any development work. Despite claims of building a sophisticated AI-powered Chinese astrology platform, the repository consists only of a README file with wallet addresses and a decorative image. The repository predates the hackathon entirely and shows no activity during the event period. This does not meet the minimum criteria for a hackathon submission."
