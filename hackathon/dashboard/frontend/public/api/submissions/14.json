  "problem_solved": "Despite advancements in agriculture and technology, food insecurity remains a global issue, but Urban gardening, homesteading and farmers markets are on the rise. Decentralized food systems can reduce our over-reliance on corporations and processed foods, protect against political instability and reconnect the people to the land. I want to build a swarm of AI agent soil microbiologists that will coach new and inexperienced urban gardeners from seed to harvest. ",
