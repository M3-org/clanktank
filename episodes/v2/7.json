While the judges appreciated the technical implementation, they unanimously questioned why internal developer tooling was being pitched as an investable project. The episode featured heated exchanges about the difference between useful tools and venture-scale businesses, culminating in 4 DUMP verdicts as judges agreed this belonged in a GitHub repo, not a pitch deck.",
