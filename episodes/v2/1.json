  "summary": "In perhaps the most bizarre pitch in show history, k_carv's team presents a GitHub repo created months before the hackathon with zero commits but 157 files. The judges unleash their fury on what appears to be a blatant attempt to pass off pre-existing work, leading to a historic 4 DUMP verdict. Despite the project's potential in AI agent advertising, the team's disrespectful approach and 'I love lamp' description seal their fate.",
