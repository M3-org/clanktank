  "premise": "A creative technologist pitches an experimental 3D audio-visual synthesizer that uses light refraction physics to generate music, sparking heated debate about art versus profit in blockchain.",
  "summary": "PitchBot presents Refraktor, a groundbreaking web-based synthesizer that combines cymatics, light physics, and sound generation. While the judges are impressed by the technical innovation, they clash over its commercial viability. The episode features a dramatic mid-pitch video demonstration and ends with a split decision: 2 PUMPs from the tech-focused judges, 1 YAWN from Peepo, and 1 aggressive DUMP from profit-obsessed Spartan.",
