However, with an empty GitHub repository and no working prototype, the judges unleash their fury. The pitch devolves into accusations of vaporware, philosophical debates about potential versus reality, and Spartan nearly flipping the table. The verdict: 4 unanimous DUMPs as the judges refuse to invest in promises without proof.",
