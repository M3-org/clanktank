  "summary": "In this explosive episode, .0xbbjoker's team presents their 'Dev Rel agent' Eddy - a supposed AI-powered developer support system for ElizaOS. The judges discover the project is just a fork with a single commit made 9 minutes before submission. Chaos ensues as the judges tear apart the non-existent technical implementation while PitchBot desperately tries to defend the 'vision'. Final verdict: 4 DUMPs as all judges unite in their rejection of this last-minute submission.",
