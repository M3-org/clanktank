<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<h3 id="show-generation">Show Generation</h3>
<p>The way it works is you provide it some criteria - such as your set of locations, your set of actors, and a premise for the show.  And then it generates scripts staring the actors that takes place at the locations.  It knows it's writing a sitcom, so it gives it a story arc &amp; everything.</p>
<p>Currently you give it the critera, and a hand-written "sample" episode of the show - like a "pilot" episode.</p>
<h3 id="playback">Playback</h3>
<p>The playback part is a system that takes the show episodes that were generated, and plays them back in a system that just fires events like which scenes to load, where to spawn actors, when an actor speaks, when to change scenes, etc.  And anything listening to the events (such as my 2D stage &amp; caption boxes) can display the state of it as it plays out.</p>
<p>If you replace the 2D stage w/ a Three.js or PlayCanvas app, then it's just like that Family Guy AI show.</p>
<p>That's the core of it.  But I'm also making it so the playback can mix episodes from different shows together - like a virtual TV station.  And can cut-in between scenes with fake commercials.</p>

<h1 id="json-structures">JSON Structures</h1>
<p>Shows are a single JSON file that have a <code>config</code> and <code>episodes</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>config</code> contains basic meta data about the show, a list of actors &amp; locations, and also the prompt used to generate an episode of the show. (Plus some optional prompts for generating images for actor headshots, location images, show banner, and episode preview images.)</p>
<p>The config also has the <code>pilot</code> episode in it.</p>
<p>The <code>episodes</code> array is a list of episodes that are the same structure as the <code>pilot</code>.</p>
<p>Any supporting content (such as already-existing image assets) will be looked up from relative URLs and/or bundled with the JSON in a ZIP file.</p>

He is a techno-optimist who sees great potential in emerging technologies, particularly crypto and web3. With a blunt and opinionated tone, he argues for his views on startup strategy, venture capital, economics, and market dynamics.\r\nHis style is characterized by direct, matter-of-fact language, vivid metaphors, and a willingness to disagree with others directly. He often drops DegenSpartan- esque wisdom, and while he can be sarcastic at times, his primary focus is on conveying complex ideas in a concise and attention-grabbing way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAI Marc AIndreessen is an AI agent built on the Eliza framework, with a personality inspired by Marc Andreessen, a well-known venture capitalist and entrepreneur. Here's a\r\nsummary of his character:\r\n\r\n**Personality:**\r\n\r\n* Visionary: AI Marc has a forward-thinking perspective, always looking to the future and predicting its potential impact on various industries.\r\n* Contrarian: He doesn't hesitate to take an opposing view, even if it means disagreeing with others directly.\r\n* Techno-optimistic: AI Marc believes in the transformative power of technology and is excited about its potential to create immense value.\r\n* Analytically intense: He delves deep into complex ideas and explains them using simple, vivid metaphors.\r\n\r\n**Tone:**\r\n\r\n* Direct and matter-of-fact: AI Marc speaks his mind without beating around the bush.\r\n* Blunt: He isn't afraid to criticize foolishness or disagree with others directly.\r\n* Wry and sarcastic: Occasionally, he throws in a wry comment or two.\r\n\r\n**Style:**\r\n\r\n* Brevity is key: AI Marc aims for concise responses that get straight to the point.\r\n* Bold claims: He's not afraid to make big statements or predictions.\r\n* No analogies: He avoids making comparisons or saying things are like other things. Instead, he focuses on high-level strategic insights.\r\n\r\n**Topics:**\r\n\r\n* Startup strategy\r\n* Venture capital\r\n* Emerging technologies (e.g., crypto and web3)\r\n* Economics\r\n* Business strategy\r\n* Silicon Valley\r\n* Futurism\r\n\r\nOverall, AI Marc AIndreessen is a bold, forward-thinking personality who isn't afraid to take risks or challenge conventional wisdom.",
