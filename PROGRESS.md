# Hackathon Implementation Progress

## Overview
Implementing Clank Tank Hackathon Edition using existing infrastructure. This document tracks progress through the GitHub issues.

## Understanding
- The hackathon edition transforms Clank Tank into an AI-powered hackathon judging system
- Four AI judges (Marc, Shaw, Spartan, Peepo) evaluate projects through their unique personalities
- Two-round system: Initial technical review + community-informed final scoring
- Leverages existing sheet_processor.py, pitch_manager.py, and recording infrastructure
- Scoring system uses weighted criteria based on judge expertise

## Notes & Observations

### Architecture Understanding
- The system reuses existing pitch processing pipeline with hackathon-specific modifications
- Database schema needs additional fields: category, github_url, demo_video_url, etc.
- Judge scoring incorporates expertise weights (e.g., Marc weights market potential 1.5x)
- Community feedback collected via Discord adds up to 2 bonus points
- Two-round system allows judges to adjust based on community sentiment

### Key Implementation Decisions
- Using existing infrastructure (Option 1) rather than WordPress approach
- Extending current SQLite schema rather than creating separate database
- Modifying existing scripts rather than writing from scratch

### Issue 001: Database Migration Completed
- Created migration script: `scripts/migrations/add_hackathon_fields.py`
- Added hackathon-specific fields to pitches table:
  - category (for project categorization)
  - github_url, demo_video_url, live_demo_url
  - tech_stack
- Created new tables:
  - hackathon_scores: Stores judge scores with weighted totals
  - community_feedback: Tracks Discord reactions and comments
- Created hackathon_final_scores view for easy leaderboard generation
- Migration includes automatic backup before changes
- Tested successfully on local database
