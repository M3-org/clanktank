Users could even vote on pitches and influence the judges' decisions.</p> <p>5/ The future of Block Tank involves higher-quality art assets, advanced multi-agent writers rooms, and deeper audience interaction. The platform's flexibility means it could expand to other show formats beyond its current Shark Tank inspiration.</p> <p>6/ Block Tank points to a new era of community-driven, AI-powered interactive entertainment. Its rapid \"submit, simulate, share\" cycle has potential across genres. </p> <p>Excited to see how this technology evolves and the experiences it enables! Let me know if you have any other questions.</p> <p>Here's a new Twitter thread explaining Block Tank, the AI-powered show generator: 1/ Introducing Block Tank - a platform that transforms user-submitted pitches into AI-generated shows. It's like Shark Tank, but with virtual judges, contestants, and an infinite variety of topics. Here's how it works under the hood: 2/ When a user submits a pitch, they provide details about their idea and background. Block Tank uses this to create an AI agent that represents the pitcher during the show. This AI agent can interact with the virtual judges, responding to questions and comments in real-time based on the user's input. 3/ At the heart of Block Tank is the \"AI Writers Room\". This system takes the user's pitch, the AI pitcher, and the profiles of the virtual judges, and generates a complete show script. The AI Writers Room can be a single entity, like a virtual Hollywood screenwriter, or a multi-agent system where judge AIs collaborate and bounce ideas off each other. 4/ Once the AI Writers Room finishes the script, Block Tank runs a detailed simulation of the show. This includes dialogue, interactions, and the final judgment from the AI panel. The whole process, from pitch submission to simulated episode, only takes 15-20 seconds. The system can then render this simulation in various formats - text, 2D animation, 3D scenes, or even VR experiences. 5/ One of the most exciting aspects of Block Tank is the potential for audience interaction and community-driven content. For example, users could vote on which pitches they want to see turned into full episodes. They could even participate as virtual judges, influencing the direction and outcome of the show. 6/ Block Tank also opens up interesting possibilities for tokenomics. Imagine a system where users spend tokens to submit high-quality pitches or to influence the judges' decisions. This could create a vibrant ecosystem around the platform, encouraging participation and innovation. 7/ As Block Tank evolves, we can expect to see even more sophisticated AI writing systems, higher quality visuals, and deeper audience engagement. The platform's modular design means it can be extended to all sorts of show formats beyond the initial Shark Tank concept. The possibilities are endless. 8/ Ultimately, Block Tank represents a glimpse into the future of entertainment - one where AI and human creativity work together to generate compelling, interactive content at scale. It's an exciting frontier, and we can't wait to see what kinds of new experiences and stories emerge from this innovative platform.</p>"},{"location":"notes/BlockTank-Concept-Prototype/","title":"Overview","text":"<p>Date: 1/18/25</p> <p>Think YOU can survive THE SIMULATION and BOUNCE THE TANK?</p> <p></p> <p>Block Tank is an AI-generated show where <code>4 AI judges</code> interact with an <code>AI pitcher</code> (generated from a personality profile of a <code>human</code> pitcher) who pitches a <code>real project idea</code> for the judges to critique and grade with: <code>pump</code>, <code>dump</code>, or <code>yawn</code>.</p> <p>The show is hosted by an <code>AI Eliza</code> and judged by <code>AI versions</code> of <code>Shaw</code>, <code>Degen Spartan</code>, <code>Marc</code>, and <code>Peepo</code>.</p> <p>Block Tank is NOT financial advice.
