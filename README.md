## About Clank Tank

Clank Tank is an autonomous entertainment platform where users submit real business pitches that are transformed into complete, simulated episodes featuring AI-generated characters, dialogue, and interactions. Inspired by "Shark Tank," our system creates entertaining show episodes that provide exposure for projects while offering AI-driven feedback.

The show features a panel of AI judges who evaluate pitches, question the presenter, and ultimately decide whether to "pump" or "dump" the project.

## How It Works

1. **Pitch Submission**: Entrepreneurs submit their project details through our [Tally/Typeform submission form](https://tally.so/r/3X8EKO)
2. **Data Processing**: Submissions flow through Google Sheets into our SQLite database with automated status tracking
3. **AI Research**: Advanced research pipeline using OpenRouter + Perplexity analyzes each pitch for enhanced context
4. **Character Creation**: AI generates character profiles and creates structured data folders for episode production
5. **Episode Generation**: AI Writers' Room creates complete episode scripts with natural dialogue and interactions
6. **Real-Time Rendering**: Episodes are rendered in 3D using PlayCanvas with JSON-based scene control
7. **Publishing**: Automated recording and YouTube upload with professional metadata and thumbnails
8. **Feedback & Exposure**: Projects gain visibility, AI-driven critique, and potential connections to capital

## Technical Architecture

The Clank Tank system uses a modular architecture with several key components:

### Core Components

1. **Pitch Management System**: Automated processing from Tally/Typeform through Google Sheets with SQLite tracking
2. **AI Research Pipeline**: OpenRouter + Perplexity integration for enhanced pitch analysis and context
3. **AI Writers' Room**: Uses Anthropic Claude to generate natural dialogue and interactions between judges and pitchers
4. **Character Data System**: Structured folders with complete submission data and formatted profiles
5. **Rendering Framework**: PlayCanvas (web-based) with planned support for Unity/Unreal for higher fidelity
6. **Show Runner**: JSON-based event system that controls the flow of scenes, dialogue, and camera work
7. **Audio Pipeline**: ElevenLabs for voice synthesis plus sound effects and transitions
8. **Recording System**: Automated tools to create high-quality recordings from rendered episodes

### Pitch Management Workflow

The system includes comprehensive tools for managing the entire pitch-to-episode pipeline:

```bash
# Process new submissions from Google Sheets
python scripts/sheet_processor.py -s "Block Tank Pitch Submission" -o ./data -j --db-file pitches.db

# Research pitches with AI analysis
python scripts/pitch_manager.py --db-file data/pitches.db --research 4Z5rGo

# Create character folders for all researched pitches
python scripts/pitch_manager.py --db-file data/pitches.db --create-character all

# Track submission status with visual indicators (ðŸŸ¡â†’ðŸ”µâ†’ðŸŸ â†’ðŸŸ¢)
python scripts/pitch_manager.py --db-file data/pitches.db --list --filter-status submitted
```

### Episode Recording

```bash
# Record an episode from generated content
node scripts/shmotime-recorder.js https://shmotime.com/shmotime_episode/your-episode-url/

# For more options
node scripts/shmotime-recorder.js --help
```

## Getting Started

### For Entrepreneurs
1. **Submit Your Pitch**: Use our [Tally submission form](https://tally.so/r/3X8EKO) to submit your project
2. **Automated Processing**: Your submission gets processed through our AI research pipeline
3. **Character Creation**: Our system creates an AI character to represent you in the show
4. **Episode Generation**: Watch for your episode to be published on our YouTube channel

### For Developers
1. **Setup Environment**: Install Python dependencies and configure Google Sheets API
2. **Process Submissions**: Use `sheet_processor.py` to import data from Google Sheets
3. **Manage Pipeline**: Use `pitch_manager.py` for research, status tracking, and character creation
4. **Monitor Progress**: Track submission status from ðŸŸ¡ submitted â†’ ðŸ”µ researched â†’ ðŸŸ  in-progress â†’ ðŸŸ¢ done

See [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md) and [scripts/pitch-pipeline.md](scripts/pitch-pipeline.md) for complete documentation.
