## About Clank Tank

Clank Tank is an autonomous entertainment platform where users submit real business pitches that are transformed into complete, simulated episodes featuring AI-generated characters, dialogue, and interactions. Inspired by "Shark Tank," our system creates entertaining show episodes that provide exposure for projects while offering AI-driven feedback.

The show features a panel of AI judges who evaluate pitches, question the presenter, and ultimately decide whether to "pump" or "dump" the project.

## How It Works

1. **Pitch Submission**: Entrepreneurs submit their project details and personal information through our [submission form](https://tally.so/r/3X8EKO)
2. **AI Simulation**: Our system creates an AI character to represent the pitcher and generates a complete episode script
3. **Real-Time Rendering**: The episode is rendered in 3D using PlayCanvas (with variants for Unity/Unreal)
4. **Publishing**: Episodes are shared via web embeds and social media clips
5. **Feedback & Exposure**: Projects gain visibility, useful critique, and potential connections to capital

## Technical Architecture

The Clank Tank system uses a modular architecture with several key components:

### Core Components

1. **AI Writers' Room**: Uses Anthropic Claude to generate natural dialogue and interactions between judges and pitchers
2. **Rendering Framework**: PlayCanvas (web-based) with planned support for Unity/Unreal for higher fidelity
3. **Show Runner**: JSON-based event system that controls the flow of scenes, dialogue, and camera work
4. **Audio Pipeline**: ElevenLabs for voice synthesis plus sound effects and transitions
5. **Recording System**: Automated tools to create high-quality recordings from rendered episodes

### Running the Recorder

The repository includes a powerful recording tool for capturing high-quality videos of episodes:

```bash
# Record an episode
node scripts/shmotime-recorder.js https://shmotime.com/shmotime_episode/your-episode-url/

# For more options
node scripts/shmotime-recorder.js --help
```

## GitHub Actions Automation

### Daily Episode Recording Workflow

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/daily-episode-recording.yml`) that automatically:

1. **Fetches** the latest JedAI Council episode from Shmotime API
2. **Records** the episode using the enhanced recorder with clean filenames
3. **Uploads** to YouTube with professional metadata and thumbnails

**Schedule:** Daily at 04:15 UTC

### Required GitHub Secrets

Set these secrets in your repository: **Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions**

```
YOUTUBE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_oauth_client_id
YOUTUBE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_oauth_client_secret  
YOUTUBE_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_youtube_refresh_token
```

**To get YouTube API credentials:**

1. **Google Cloud Console:** Create a project at [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. **Enable YouTube Data API v3:** In APIs & Services â†’ Library
3. **Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials:** In APIs & Services â†’ Credentials
4. **Configure OAuth consent screen:** Add your email as test user
5. **Generate refresh token:** Use `scripts/setup_youtube_auth.py` (if available) or Google OAuth Playground

### Testing the Workflow

- **Manual trigger:** Go to Actions tab â†’ "Daily JedAI Council Episode Recording" â†’ "Run workflow"
- **View logs:** Check the Actions tab for detailed execution logs
- **Artifacts:** Session logs and thumbnails are archived for 30 days

### Workflow Features

- âœ… **Smart episode detection** with API validation
- âœ… **Clean filename generation** (e.g., `S1E12_JedAI-Council_the-stealth-strategy.mp4`)
- âœ… **Professional YouTube uploads** with titles, descriptions, tags, and thumbnails
- âœ… **Error handling** and detailed logging
- âœ… **Artifact archival** for debugging and record-keeping
- âœ… **Automatic cleanup** to manage storage usage
